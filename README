This repository contains the prototype for the BuddyApp, an idea that surged for the Mindshifting challenge created by NOVA IMS's Dean Professor Miguel Castro Neto.
This application intendeds to revolutionise how we interact with LLM's, not only by organising our lives and minds but also to help coping with deep emotions like anxiety or stress.
